.SH NAME
freedoas \- minimal doas-like privilege escalation utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B freedoas
[\-Lns] [\-C \fIconfig\fR] [\-u \fIuser\fR] \fIcommand\fR [\fIarg\fR ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
doas is a minimalistic privilege escalation utility originally from OpenBSD, designed to replace the sudo utility. freedoas is a compatible implementation that provides similar functionality with a focus on portability. It should be noted that the freedoas code has not been audited for security vulnerabilities, so it is recommended to use it with caution, or alternatively not use it at all.
.PP
The
.B freedoas
utility allows a permitted user to run a command as another user, as specified in the configuration file (default:
.I /etc/doas.conf
).

Configuration files must be writable only by root. They may be world-readable.
.PP
By default, password authentication is required for all commands unless overridden in the configuration.
.PP
freedoas creates a clean environment for the command, setting:
.BR $HOME ,
.BR $LOGNAME ,
.BR $USER ,
and
.B $SHELL
based on the target user. The variables
.BR $DISPLAY ,
.BR $TERM ,
and
.BR $PATH
are inherited. Other variables are cleared unless explicitly preserved.
.SH OPTIONS
